WorldGenVillage v1.0.0 for Bukkit code base 1.5R2

!!!! THIS IS NOT A NORMAL BUKKIT PLUGIN !!!!
!!! DO NOT COPY INTO YOUR PLUGINS FOLDER !!!

This provides a customized generator for villages in that they can
now spawn in most biome types.  Use with the WorldGen plugin to make
villages in just about any biome you'd want.

This is a customized version of underlying Minecraft class objects
for a bukkit (craftbukkit / spigot) server.  You must replace the original
code base with this new class to add functionality.  You will need to
copy the contents of this jar file (exclude the README and META-INF; 
you should only copy the entire contents of the net folder) into your 
server's jar file.  This should replace the requried class objects 
with the new customized ones.

I use 7zip to open and edit jar contents, but feel free to use any other
compatible utility to edit jar packages.
